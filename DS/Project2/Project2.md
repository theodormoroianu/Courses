# Project 2

## Implemented algorithms:

### Min-Max-Heap

    Really ugly code for a really useless DS

### Pairing Heap

    Really cool DS, I feel like it is not used at it's full potential with basic heap operations

### Treap

    Most powefull DS ever created by a living creature. My implementations is quite limited tho

### Splay Tree

    Well I only have the splay implemented, which I actually partially stole from the internet so yeah :))
